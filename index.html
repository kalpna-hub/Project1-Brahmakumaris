        <h1>Raja Yoga Meditation</h1>
        <p>‘Raja’ means ruler and ‘Yoga’ refers to ‘communion’. So, Rajyoga is a divine communion which makes us self sovereign. 
            Meditation comes from the Latin word- Mederi which means to heal. Rajyoga Meditation is thus a self-healing process.
            By practicing it, our eyes open to a totally new world- a world inside, activating our dormant inner energies in the form
            of powers and nourishing the spiritual awareness of the self, Supreme, time and world. Once we start exploring this inner world,
            we find the root of our problems and also the key to their solutions. We start to respond to situations, rather than just reacting
            to them and begin to live in harmony.
            Meditation is the journey inwards, a journey of self-discovery or, in fact, re-discovery. Meditation
             is time taken for quiet reflection and silence, away from the hustle and bustle of daily living. Taking 
             time out enables us to come back to a centred place of being. In our modern world, the pace of life is
              growing ever faster and we are losing touch with our true inner peace and power. When we no longer feel
               grounded, we can experience ourselves pushed and pulled in many different directions. It is at this point 
               that we start to experience stress and a feeling of being trapped. Gradually, over time,
             this feeling leads to illness and disease, as our mental, emotional and physical health is thrown out of balance. </p>
