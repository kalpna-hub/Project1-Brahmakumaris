        <h1>Raja Yoga Meditation</h1>
        <p>Meditation is the journey inwards, a journey of self-discovery or, in fact, re-discovery. Meditation
             is time taken for quiet reflection and silence, away from the hustle and bustle of daily living. Taking 
             time out enables us to come back to a centred place of being. In our modern world, the pace of life is
              growing ever faster and we are losing touch with our true inner peace and power. When we no longer feel
               grounded, we can experience ourselves pushed and pulled in many different directions. It is at this point 
               that we start to experience stress and a feeling of being trapped. Gradually, over time,
             this feeling leads to illness and disease, as our mental, emotional and physical health is thrown out of balance. </p>
